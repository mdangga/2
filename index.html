			<h6>Thesis</h6>
			<p>COVID-19 health protocol violators should be sanctioned Thesis COVID-19 health protocol violators should be sanctioned. As we know, the number of people infected with the covid virus is still increasing in our country, but some people still ignore the health protocol by not wearing mask and keeping their distance.</p>
			<h6>Argument</h6>
			<p>Firstly, the violators will continue to ignore the health protocol suggested by the government if they aren't sanctioned. By being sanctioned, they will feel deterred and ashamed so that in the future they will obey the rules given. Secondly, by sanctioning the violators, they will understand responsibility. Not only does it prevent us from being infected by the virus, but adhering to health protocols also keep others safe. We may not feel infected, but at least we prevent bad things by continuing to keep distance and wearing masks. That way, we will fulfill our responsibilities to ourselves and others. Lastly, giving sanctions to the violators will make them more aware of the danger of COVID-19. It is said that WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, which means that this virus is very dangerous, so it is best to continue to maintain health and avoid COVID-19.</p>
			<h6>Conclusion</h6>
			<p>Therefore, the health protocol violators should be sanctioned because of the reasons given above.</p>
